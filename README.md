Sentiment analysis on songs in John Mayor's album "sob_rock" using a Textblob. 

When a sentence is passed into Textblob it gives two outputs: polarity and subjectivity.

Polarity is the output that lies between [-1,1], where -1 refers to negative sentiment and +1 refers to positive sentiment. 

Subjectivity is the output that lies within [0,1] and refers to personal opinions and judgments.
With scores closer to 1 indicating a higher level of subjectivity and being based mostly on opinion.
